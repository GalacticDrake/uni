# University Website

This project does not contain a fully functional website, as it is used for usability evaluation (under UX). Features included are referred from proposed changes. It is based on Xiamen University Website (as of 2022).

## Disclaimer

University websites often contain thousands to ten thousands of pages, and is usually controlled by a CMS. Hence, it is not possible to duplicate the contents of the original university.

It should be emphasised that this project is not optimised for actual use (media size, file size, etc).

## Pages Available

- Home
- About -> Basic background and contact info
- Admissions -> Faculties and scholarship
- Programmes -> Undergraduate
- Campus Life -> Facilities and accommodation

## Backend Involvement

Since this project is only used for one part of the usability study, there is no backend involvement. Data extracted is done using a "mock" api and stored as JavaScript objects.
